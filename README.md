# Learning Journey

Documenting my journey learning different technologies. Starting with basic bash scripting
and building up to more complex projects.

## Current Focus
- Implementing Data Structures and algorithms
- Learning bash scripting through simple automation projects
- Implementing some ML concepts I find interesting
- Building probability visualisation tools that help with my understanding of concepts
- Tinkering wih electronics and microcontrollers
## Repository Structure
- bash-automation: Shell scripts and automation tools
- python-data-science:
- machine-learning:
- web-development: (Coming soon)
- arduino
- data-structures-&-algs:

## Featured Projects
